In the figure below (Fig 2) the results of the computations generated with
<a name="alg2" href="gdsalg.html">the algorithm</a> are presented.
</p>
The test data are obtained from two dikes in the Netherlands.
The time interval of measurements is 5 minutes.
One dike, the Ommelanderzeedijk was geohydraulic instable
[<a name="bib", href="gdsref.html">4</a>] at the time of the data gathering.
The other dike, Watergraafsmeerdijk, is not geohydraulic instable.

<I>
Supportive evidence of internal erosion computation.
The heuristics is that instable dikes (e.g. instable test objects along e.g. an eroding riverbank) are more
responsive with outliers to increases in 0.5 kPa global perturbation in the pressure level than stable dikes
(stable test objects along e.g. a riverbank).
There are <B>87% outliers in the Ommelanderzeedijk</B> purple line and <B>14% in the Watergraafsmeerdijk</B>.
From the fit of red-black lines one sees in both two
cases we have a reasonably good unperturbed model.
</I>
</p>
The conclusion is that more outliers in the purple line (see: <a name="alg2" href="gdsalg.html">the algorithm</a>)
is an indication of geohydraulic instability.
The latter can be traced back to (dike) internal erosion
[<a name="bib", href="gdsref.html">4</a>].
</p>
In the <a name="alg3" href="gdsalg3.html"><B>the next section</B></a>
the reader can find proof with synthetic data that a progressive
lack of random movement dampening material (erosion)
is related to the outliers in the purple line (see: <a name="alg2" href="gdsalg.html">the algorithm</a>).
