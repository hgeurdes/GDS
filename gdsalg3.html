<B><I><u>Results of computations on synthetic data:</u></I></B>
</P>
In the figures below (Fig 3 and 4) the results of the computations on synthetic data
generated with
<a name="alg2" href="gdsalg.html">the algorithm</a> are presented.
</p>
The basic test data are obtained from the Stammerdijk. This sample contains an
hourly record of Water level, Temperature and Pressure.
In order to generate a comparable synthetic data series of 5 minutes interval,
we created simulated data points between the real hourly interval Stammerdijk data.
</p>
With the use of synthetic data it was subsequently investigated
whether the outlier structure in the purple line
can be connected to an aspect of erosion.
In this case the progression of riverbank/coastal erosion was
simulated with the use of dike data (Stammerdijk) that was on a 5 minutes
interval perturbed with an amount of random movement.
</p>
It is a hypothesis that when water inside an geo-object
can increasingly show more random freedom of movement,
that the amount of dampening material is eroded away by the abrasive action
of the water.
The amount of randomness in the water level inside the object is expressed
in a factor designated Rf.
</p>
Although the Rf factor is, of course, only indicative of erosion, it is good to
present the basic way in which the data points were generated:
</p>
stamOmmOUT[j]<-stamIN[n]*randIN[j]
</p>
with:
</p>
randIN<-1+(sgnIN*randIN*Rf) and,
</p>
sgnIN<-sign(0.5-runif(1834)) 
</p>
Note that A<-B means: A "becomes" B and we used N=1834 generated 5 min interval data points.
</P>
The array randIN contains random generated numbers (R runif).
The sgnIN array contains the random direction of the fluctuation.
As can be seen, the final array used was stamOmmOUT where the Rf is a factor that
allows the amount of plus or minus deviation from the measured values of the Stammerdijk.
(array stamIN). In the two figures below, X represents the Waterlevel
(based on X<-stamOmmOUT).
T and P are generated in a similar way but they do not vary in the numerical experiments
represented in the two figures below.
</p>
In the  two figures below (Fig 3 and 4) two series computations are
presented where we only varied the random factor Rf of the
Water level time series but did not change
the Temperature and the Pressure values in the respective time-series.
In figure 3 we employed "an average" randomness (Rf=0.005).

<I>
Presentation of a medium size disturbance Rf=0.005.
The time series holds 1834 values. X represents the water level,
T represents the temperature and P represents the Pressure.
On the left hand side of the figure, one sees the purple line with <B>35%
computed outlier mismatches</B> from the measured water level
represented by the black line. The left hand lower panel represents
the fit of the red line with the measure values.
Middle lower panel represents the combined purple,
red and black lines. The real hourly data of the
Stammerdijk gave rise to per 5 minutes
computed values based on the random factor Rf=0.005.
</I>
</p>
In figure 4, based upon the same T and P time series as in Figure 3, the Water level
randomness is increased to Rf=0.1.

<I>
Presentation of a relative high disturbance Rf=0.1.
The time series holds 1834 values.
X represents the water level, T represents the temperature and P represents
the Pressure.
On the left hand side of the figure, one sees the purple line
with <B>84% computed outlier mismatches</B>
from the measured water level represented by the black line.
The left hand lower panel represents the fit of the red line
with the measure values. Middle lower panel represents
the combined purple, red and black lines.
The real hourly data of the Stammerdijk gave rise to per 5 minutes
computed values based on the random factor Rf=0.1.
</I>
</p>
Although the results of the Rf=0.005 are still higher than
the Watergraafsmeer results <a name="alg2" href="gdsalg2.html">(fig 2) Watergraafsmeerdijk</a> 
the computer experiment with synthetic data supports the
idea that internal lack of material to dampen the freedom of movement
is related to the outliers in the purple line.
Note that the Rf=0.1 simulations coincide with the outcome of the Ommelanderzeedijk, i.e
<a name="alg2" href="gdsalg2.html">(fig 2) Ommelanderzeedijk</a>.

<U>
This supports the notion that erosion progression can be
monitored in this way</U>.

caused by hydropower dams. We also provide the basic design for a
