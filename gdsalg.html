In the figure below (Fig 1) the flow of the data is presented.</p>
The model aims to obtain a random dynamical systems description of water level as output variable.
The temperature and pressure are input variables.
Note that the model is purely statistical. No physics assumptions are made.
In [<a name="bib", href="gdsref.html">3</a>] we find proof
that an initial approximative model can be converted to a better model, if a cocycle is found.
In this sense the numerical analysis is doing the model-theorizing
from the data. It must be noted that, most likely we are working with random differential equations
with solution sets that overlap [<a name="bib", href="gdsref.html">7</a>].
</p>
Looking at Fig 1, after the first data cleaning module, we employed an initial linear random differential equation.
as a basis for the computations.
Subsequently, a cocycle (flow) structure is obtained [<a name="bib", href="gdsref.html">3</a>] in the box
labeled "RDS model cocycle".
</p>
Subsequently, a water level is computed and presented. The latter is not a trivial representation of the computed cocycle values.
There are two cases.
One unperturbed, presented in the red-line (follow the blue 1 label) and one
perturbed pressure (delta=0.5 kPa) presented in the purple line (follow the green 2 label).

The flow of the numerics through the computations is as follows.
The inputs are time series in Pressure, Temperature and Water level in geo-environments like riverbank or coast.
First the unperturbed model is computed.
Follow the blue 1 to see the flow of the computation.
The outcome is represented in a red line.
The red-line is checked to fit the measured data in the black line (Fig. 1).
If a reasonably good fit between measured (black - line) water level and
computed (red-line) water level is found, then,
the pressure is globally increased with 0.5kPa.
In the numerics flow this is done along the green 2.
</I></P>
The starting point of the perturbation computations
is the (horizontal line) exit of the Water level computation module. Then the perturbed P enters the cocycle via interpolation.
Finally, Water level is computed again and presented in a purple line.(along the green 2).
</p>
Then we have three lines. The black line representing
the measurements, the red-line representing the unperturbed model
and the purple line representing the perturbed model.

In the <a name="alg2" href="gdsalg2.html"><B>following section</B></a> it
is demonstrated that this is related to geo-environment internal erosion.
